# SULFR
Self-Universal Learning by Facet Recognition (SULFR) is a self-learning and explainable AI that mimics bio-intelligence, intend to achieve the real-time performance of AI models.

# Why SULFR?
Self-Universal Learning by Facet Recognition (from now on, SULFR) is a self-learning AI like you and me that can decide on real-time decisions based on data patterns. Real-time performance is one of the critical initial goals. There is still much work in AI research, especially on explainable AI. SULFR will be an open-source, crowd-sourced framework that can perform any human or animal bio-intelligence tasks.

# Why SULFR framework will work?
SULFR is based on the DARTH framework, my Capstone project at SMU for my Data Science master's degree, developed with Apurv Mittal and Tai Chowdhury. An eminent and renowned expert, Dr. Daniel Engels, advised DARTH and Harsha Komanapalli.
DARTH framework is a set of models that can detect Phishing Emails using a multi-faceted, composite feature to identify phishing emails with great accuracy and have more room to improve, though DARTH achieved 99.98% accuracy. 
DARTH framework doesn't rely on single or just multiple neural networks to detect phishing; it uses a novel approach of splitting the emails into its elements and gathering information about phishing in every facet of email elements. This novel approach consistently outperformed every other model, with enough room to spare.
SULFR will build upon the DARTH framework to be a generic explainable AI that can be used in any problem domain.

Like real-world bio-intelligence (including human intelligence), SULFR uses a broad spectrum of scientific knowledge, including Statistics (regression), biophysical chemistry, evolution and physiology of animal brain structure, and DNA-like data structures encode data for robust replication.

# What language is SULFR based on?
SULFR is based on Python (for the most part) and will use PyTorch (though DARTH used TensorFlow).

# Why is performance important?
SULFR must work in real-time (for example, self-driving automobiles) to be safe for human use. If there is no real-time performance of models, the framework will fail the essential requirement for bio-intelligence and real-time decision making. Animals must decide in real-time with new inputs to survive in this world, so SULFR must perform in real-time to survive in this world.

# Who are the developers?
Currently, it is developed by Ravi Sivaraman (rsivaraman@smu.edu) and advised by Dr. Daniel Engels.

# Aren't others doing AI?
Yes, they do. But most are closed source, and a lot of explainable AI work needs to be done; this will be my attempt to create an explainable AI with real-time performance to be used in any problem domain.
The scope of this project is enormous for even a single organization to create an AI that essentially makes a model of our current world (or Universe) in given detail. This type of work requires crowd-sourced development.

# Who can contribute?
Currently, until the first release, it will be by me, Ravi Sivaraman. Further along, I will publish a set of APIs that other experts in those fields can implement to augment the SULFR framework.
